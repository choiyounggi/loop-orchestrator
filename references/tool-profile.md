# Tool profile — pluggable capability roles

loop-orchestrator is environment-neutral by default: it depends on no specific
MCP server, skill, or agent (only the bundled `test-quality-auditor`). The **tool
profile** lets each installation plug its own tools into a few named *capability
roles*. If you configure a role, the skills use your tool; if you don't, they use
the generic built-in behavior. Nothing breaks when nothing is configured.

## Roles

| Role        | Purpose                                          | Used by (step)                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `intake`    | work-list source — an issue tracker the parent/child issues come from | orchestrate Phase 0 (Intake) |
| `knowledge` | domain facts, business policy, code/status values | loop-implement step 1 (Analyze); orchestrate Phase 0/2 |
| `tacit`     | past incidents, edge cases, coupling/danger zones | loop-implement step 1 (Analyze) + step 6 (Self-review) |
| `plan`      | producing a non-trivial implementation plan       | loop-implement step 2 (Plan); orchestrate decomposition |
| `verify`    | running the project's tests / build / QA checks   | loop-implement step 5 (Run); orchestrate Phase 5 (integration) |
| `explore`   | locating code, symbols, call sites (read-only)    | loop-implement step 1 (Analyze) |

Roles are optional and extensible — you may add custom keys; the resolver passes
them through, and a skill uses a role only if it knows that role by name.

### `intake` — the issue-tracker entry (optional)

When `intake` is configured and the user names a parent issue (key or URL),
orchestrate Phase 0 reads that issue and its children: the parent supplies the
overall goal/architecture, each child becomes a candidate task. With `intake` unset
(or for a free-text goal), orchestrate decomposes the natural-language goal itself —
the original behavior. So a Jira/GitHub/Linear shop plugs its tracker here; everyone
else just states a goal. Example mapping to the Atlassian MCP:

```json
{ "intake": { "kind": "mcp", "ref": "atlassian",
              "how": "getJiraIssue(parent) + searchJiraIssuesUsingJql('parent=<KEY>')",
              "when": "user gives a parent issue key/URL; children become tasks" } }
```

**Partial resume (one child already done).** A child counts as *completed* if the
user names it, or — when intake exposes status — its tracker status is Done.
orchestrate (Phase 0) drops completed children from the task set (no session), but
seeds the dependency graph with their **base outputs**, so any task that depends on
one still gets its exact signature injected (Phase 3 step 0). Never drop a completed
child silently — a dependent would lose its premise and re-create it. `setup-
worktrees.sh` is idempotent, so a branch/worktree the user already made is detected
and kept. To declare a completed child, give its **key + the exact signature it
exposed + where it's merged** (or let orchestrate read the signature from the
integration branch); see the README "이슈트래커 진입" section for a copy-paste prompt.

## A role is a tool, not a loop (the nesting guard)

A role plugs a **tool or information source into one step** of the verification
loop — it never replaces the loop. Do **not** map a role to a tool that runs its
own implement / verify / retry loop, or to another orchestrator (e.g. an
"implement-loop" skill). loop-implement already *is* the implementation loop;
nesting a second loop inside it makes the retry count, the Definition-of-Done
judgment, and the test-quality auditor gate ambiguous about which loop owns them,
and tends to drag in an environment-specific tool's own assumptions.

- `plan` is allowed because it **produces a plan and returns** — it does not
  implement or iterate.
- `verify` must **run tests and report** — not run a test-*and-fix* loop. A QA
  tool that auto-fixes belongs outside, not as a role.
- There is intentionally **no `implement` role**. Implementation is the loop's
  own step 4; that is the single owner of the implement/retry cycle.

## Config files & precedence

Layered like `git config`, lowest to highest:

```
built-in defaults  <  ~/.claude/loop-orchestrator/tools.json  <  <repo>/.loop-orchestrator/tools.json
```

- **per-user** (`~/.claude/loop-orchestrator/tools.json`) — your machine's tools,
  applied across every project you run the orchestrator in.
- **per-repo** (`<repo>/.loop-orchestrator/tools.json`) — commit it to share a
  team-standard mapping; overrides your per-user file.
- Merge is **per role and per field**: a per-repo file can override one role — or
  one field of a role — and inherit the rest. To drop an inherited value, set that
  field to `null`.

## Schema

```jsonc
{
  "<role>": {
    "kind": "mcp" | "skill" | "agent" | "cli" | "default",
    "ref":  "<server / skill / agent name or command>",   // omit when kind=default
    "how":  "<short invocation hint, e.g. tool call sequence>",  // optional
    "when": "<one line: when this role should be consulted>"     // optional
  }
}
```

- `kind: "default"` (or an omitted role) → use loop-implement's own generic
  behavior for that role (no external dependency).
- Unknown/invalid config file → ignored with a warning (fail-open to defaults).

See `examples/tools.example.json` for an RTB-flavored profile
(wiki-rag / rtb-lore / rtb:plan).

## Resolving (for skills/scripts)

```sh
sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-tools.sh            # resolved JSON
sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-tools.sh --summary  # one line per role
sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-tools.sh --role plan
```

`orchestrate` resolves the profile once and writes each role's guidance into the
per-task `<tools_guidance>` brief, so spawned worker sessions get it even if they
can't re-read the config. `loop-implement` resolves it directly when run standalone.
